            <h2>Learning Experience</h2>
            <p>
              The learning experience throughout the project was profound,
              encompassing various aspects of front-end development, including
              HTML, CSS. Module experience involved the integration of
              frameworks like Bootstrap for responsive design. Throughout the
              project i know how to use git and github and management of my
              project.

            <p>
              Overall, I found the module to be quite enriching, offering a
              positive learning journey. Nevertheless, there were moments during
              class where I encountered challenges in grasping the material
              until I engaged in practical application. Thankfully, the module
              instructor remained accessible, offering valuable assistance and
              encouragement. One particular support session stands out as
              exceptionally beneficial, allowing me to seek clarification and
              receive prompt feedback. As I anticipate the upcoming term, I'm
              filled with enthusiasm to delve deeper into Javascript, eager to
              expand my proficiency in interacting with tags and elements.

            <h2>Website Design Progress</h2>
            <p>
              Being someone who is deeply passionate about both technology and
              design, I've always been attracted to the sleek and modern
              aesthetic that accompanies them. When I was first introduced to
              the realm of web development, I was immediately fascinated by the
              opportunity it presented to craft visually stunning interfaces
              that not only dazzled the eyes but also served practical purposes.
              During my initial year in college, I was tasked with a project to
              conceptualize a wireframe and prototype for a zoo management
              system. This project served as a catalyst, fueling my already
              burning passion for design and technology.It was a moment where I
              realized the immense potential web development held for marrying
              aesthetics with functionality. As I continue my journey, I find
              myself constantly inspired to push the boundaries of what's
              achievable in web development. The fusion of design and technology
              continues to be my driving force, propelling me toward exploring
              new and innovative concepts that redefine the digital landscape. I
              eagerly anticipate the opportunity to embark on further projects
              where I can continue to showcase my passion for sleek and
              purposeful design.
